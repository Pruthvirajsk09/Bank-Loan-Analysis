primary objective is to extract actionable insights related to loan applications, funding, repayments, and borrower demographics, facilitating informed decision-making in
financial services.

### Objectives

- Trend Identification: Detect patterns in loan applications, approval rates, and repayment statuses.
- Financial Health Evaluation: Assess key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Total Funded Amount, Average Interest Rate, and Loan Status.
- Strategic Decision Support: Aid in strategic planning for the bank's credit and loan offerings.
